# Cypress Interview

This provides a basic setup to interview prospective Test Automation Engineers at Freshly using the Cypress framework.

Steps:
 - Install node ( I would recommend using a version manager like "nvm" but it is not required) 
   - Node versions supported by Cypress [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html#Node-js)
 - Install yarn
 - Install Cypress
 - Run: `yarn cy:open` to start the Cypress UI Runner.
